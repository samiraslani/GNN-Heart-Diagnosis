# ü´Ä Graph Neural Networks for Heart Disease Prediction

## üìñ Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis are essential for reducing the burden of heart conditions. Traditional diagnostic tools like stress testing and manual evaluation are resource-intensive and not always accessible. This project leverages **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model the relationships between patients using clinical features, offering a novel and efficient way to predict heart disease severity.

## Objective

To build and compare **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)** and **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** for heart disease classification using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. Each patient is modeled as a node in a graph, with edges representing similarity in medical history.

## Methods

### Node and Edge Construction

- **Nodes**: Represent individual patients, using clinical features (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure).
- **Edges**: Represent similarity between patients, constructed using:
  1. **Manual rules** (based on thresholds of medical metrics)
  2. **Autoencoders** (for learned latent-space similarity)
  3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (best performance; K=5)

> **Note**: Dataset features were normalized to prevent skewed similarity due to varying feature scales.

### Label Masking

To avoid label leakage in the graph, we implemented **masked label aggregation**:
- During training, a node only accesses the labels of its **neighbors**, not its own.
- Achieved via adjacency matrix multiplication: `Y' = A √ó Y`.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) (303 records)
- **Target**: Severity of heart disease (classes 0‚Äì4)
- **Features**: Age, cholesterol, blood pressure, max heart rate, etc.
- **Handling Missing Data**:
  - Numerical fields: Mean imputation
  - Categorical fields: Mode imputation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Class Imbalance Handling

- **Stratified sampling** used for train/test split (80/20)
- **Weighted loss functions** to penalize minority class errors
